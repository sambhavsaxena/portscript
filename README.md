## Creating pages

You can generate `directories` by creating a screens/pages folder in the root directory. Components can also be created and the app can be simply extended in the same way we do in case of a CRA app. There are no constraint to possibilities.

You can edit the attributes according to html. The icon can be manually replaced as well. The styling (`style.css` in `/css`) can be manually changed according to need as can be changed the font (in `/build_scripts`).

The pages are generated in the `build` directory on root after you run `npm run build` which you can use to deploy your site.
